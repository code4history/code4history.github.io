title: Code for History
description: "Code for History" is a community that uses IT technology to solve historical problems. But I want to emphasize that for us, IT technology is "means" not "purpose". "Purpose" is about solving historical problems, so we use even non-IT methods if necessary. It's a community that puts the top priority on solving problems by any means.
